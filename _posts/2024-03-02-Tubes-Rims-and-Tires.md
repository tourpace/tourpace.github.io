**Two simple questions** - your answer to the first one may determine your answer for the next one.

**Question #1: Tubes or tubeless?**

I can remember when this was never a question to consider - but times change. Bicycle tires always used to have some sort of tube - either you had a seperate tube with a clincher tire or an internal tube in a sew-up (tubular) tire. I will not be addressing tubular (sew-up) tires in this discussion - sorry.

Tubeless tires have been around on vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles) and had been exclusive to motorized vehicles. As you may know these tires are mounted by mechanics to your vehicles rims at the shop. You can change a tire (wheel already on a rim) when you have a flat - but cannot change a tire on such a rim without very specialized equipment and knowledge.

Tubeless bicycle tires started in mountain biking first because flats happened more often off-road due to thorns, sharp objects, and big hits (mountain bike wheels took on many surfaces that would compress the tire and puncture the tube between the tire and the rim). The introduction of tubeless mountain bike tires allowed lower tire pressures for better traction and control. Tire sealant was necessary for tubeless tires to deal with small thorns or punctures that often happen off-road. The sealant fills the hole(s) and hardens so you can keep riding without changing a flat. Tire sealant eventually dries out inside the tire so new sealant is added every few months.

Tubeless tires require more specialized rims, rim strip, and valves. Using tubeless tires requires making sure that the rims and tires you choose will work well together. The intial installation and sealant setup requires patience and practice to get everything just right. Some bicyclists just have their local bike shop do this - always a good choice.

Tubeless tires moved from the mountain bike world into gravel and road bicycling. Most would agree that gravel and road tubeless tires should be wider and are best suited with lower tire pressures. Tubeless mountain bike tires and gravel tires are rarely are run greater than 35- 40 PSI. Road tubeless tires can be run above 65 PSI on a hooked rim.

**Pros of tubeless tires:**
- Lower tire pressures offer better control/feel and more comfort
- Overall setup can be lighter in weight than using tubes
- Small punctures do not require a tube change - sealant fills the hole
- Current trend, no FOMO

**Cons of tubeless tires:**
- More expensive initial cost (tire, sealant, tape, valve stem, and setup)
- Too large a hole or cut in a tire still requires a tube to get home
- Can get very messy when you have a blow-out
- Sealant must be maintained

Traditional tubed tires (clinchers) have been around since the very late 1800's  - invented and patented in 1892 by [Thomas B. Jeffrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_B._Jeffery).

Tubed (clincher) tires only require an appropriate sized inner tube and corresponding clincher wheel/rim. There is a short leaning curve to properly change a flat tube/tire and the process is very simple. Many people still visit the local bike shop to have a flat fixed but more seasoned bicyclists learn to change their own flats. The most important thing to remember when changing a flat tire is to find what caused the flat in the first place. Clincher tires and tubes are still very popular and are a very proven and reliable technology.

**Pros of tubed (clincher) tires:**
- Easy to maintain
- Cheaper than most tubeless tires
- Tubes can be repaired
- Easy to change while on a ride

**Cons of tubed (clincher) tires:**
- more prone to flats
- more prone to pinch flats at really low tire pressures
- can be heavier than a tubeless setup
- Not what the pro bicycling riders are using (but they have mechanics who maintain their stuff)

**Question #2: Hooked rims or hookless rims?**

If you choose tubed (clincher) tires than your only choice for rims are hooked (clincher) rims. Tubeless tires can also be run on hooked (clincher) style rims. 

**Pros of hooked rims:**
- works with tubed or tubeless tires
- proven rim technology
- been around for over 100 years
- wider variety of rim choices
- works well with a variety of tire pressures

**Cons of hooked rims:**
- heavier than hookless rims
- not quite as aerodynamic where the tire interfaces
- not the current trend

But as the rim technology has developed there are now hookless rims based on the same concept as automobile tire rims. Again, the first hookless bicycle rims started out on mountain bike wheels and now have made their way to road bicycles.

Above is a comparison of a hooked (clincher) rim on the left and the hookless rim on the right.

Why the increased development of hookless rims??? The big push is in carbon wheelsets made by Zipp, Enve, and Cadex (the big three). They found that they can make a carbon rim lighter, stronger, and cheaper without having to add hooks to the rims to help hold the tire on the rim. Hookless rims with the right tire can be more aerodynamic and same precious time for racing bicyclists. These hookless rims can only be run as tubeless and require a higher tolerances for the tire for it to work properly.

There is a bit of talk about the safety of the hookless rim/tubeless tire recently in the racing world due to a crash during a race caused by the tire blowing off a wheel. Read about the incident on [Bike Radar](https://www.bikeradar.com/news/uci-hookless-investigation) if you are interested. Boyd Cycling (makers of high end wheelsets) offers the recommendation that if you use hookless rims for the road - never exceed 65 PSI. Boyd has a nice [synopsis about hookless rims](https://boydcycling.com/pages/hookless) that is worth a read.

There is a video circulating across the Internet that has generated alot of discussion of a major hookless rim/tubeless tire fail. It is one example only and the rim/tire combination may not be ideal. Watch below if you have a few more minutes.

**Pros of hookless rims:**
- can be made lighter and cheaper
- faster for racing cyclists

**Cons of hookless rims:**
- possible safety issues (TBD)
- require a very tight tolerance for the tires used
- not suitable for higher tire pressures

**What I Prefer..**

I prefer simplicty and my choice has for the most part been tubes in a tubed tire on a hooked rim. The only exception I have made was when I mountain biked in the southwest US and then I used a tubeless setup on hooked rims because of so many thorns from cactus. I have also tried tubeless with hooked rims on my road/gravel bike and got so tired of always maintaining the frikin' tubeless tire and sealant. And on the occasion where the tubless setup got too big of a hole - well I had sealant as we say "spew" everywhere - including on me! And then I still had to use a tube!

On road and gravel I run tubes and I have had very few flats. If I do - I just find the cause of the flat, remove the cause, and insert a new tube... off and running is just a few minutes. No mess, no adding sealant, and no difficulty in mounitng a specific tire to a specific rim. I do run wider tires on my bikes - the narrowest tire that I run is on my road bike is 700 x 38's, inflated to a modest 40 psi. For gravel I run the pressure at 35 psi and no pinch flats.

 Tubes most often can be patched and re-used - so **Yes to Tubes** for me!
