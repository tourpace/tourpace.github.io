Tubes or tubeless? Hooked rims or hookless? Tubed tire or tubeless?

So many questions these days and I'm not sure why on most bikes. I prefer simplicty and my choice has for the most part been tubes in a tubed tire on a hooked rim. The only exception I have made was when I mountain biked in the southwest US and then I used a tubeless setup on hooked rims because on so many thorns from cactus.

On road and gravel I run tubes and I have had very few flats. If I do - I just find the cause of the flat, remove the cause, and insert a new tube... off and running is just a few minutes. No mess, no adding sealant, and no difficulty in mounitng a specific tire to a specific rim. I do run wider tires on my bikes - the narrowest tire that I run is on my road bike is 700 x 38's, inflated to a modest 40 psi. For gravel I run the pressure at 35 psi and no pinch flats.

I have tried tubeless on my road/gravel bike and got so tired of always maintaining the frikin' tubeless tire and sealant. And on the occasion where the tubless setup got too big of a hole - well I had sealant as we say "spew" everywhere - including on me! Tubes most often can be patched and re-used - so Yes to Tubes!

Now I am reading [Gear Junkie for example](https://gearjunkie.com/biking/hookless-wheels-rims-tires-how-they-work-benefits) about rims that are hookless for bicycle tires that are tubeless. Why??? Evidently hookless rims with the right tubeless tires will mak the tire more aerodynamic - imagine the watts saved! Okay, really??? The majority of cycists or amateurs that want this probably would amaze me, but how crazy is it to do this?

Evidently car and motorcycle rims are hookless - so shouldn't bicycle rims too? Evidently you can make that carbon fiber rim stronger, lighter, and cheaper - who does'nt want that??? Well - not me.

For a closing thought - watch this video of a tubeless setup on hookless rims, now that seems safe...
