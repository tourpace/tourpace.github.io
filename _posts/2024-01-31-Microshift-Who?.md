It is often said in the bike industry that there are only three (3) major component manufactruers: Shimano, SRAM, and Campagnolo. But many years ago I couldn't get my hands on any Shimano bar-end shifters (other than eBay) and I found that a company called Microshift that made bar-end shifters that would work with Shimano rear derailleurs up to 9 speeds. The Microshift bar-ends weren't quite the same as my previous Shimano's - but they got the job done.

My major beef with Shimano and SRAM is that they have almost abandoned bar-end shifters - I believe that SRAM still has some mechanical bar-ends for the tri-bike scene. But it appears that SRAM plans to pahse out with electronic versions.

Microshift continues to make bar-ends for their derailleurs and also for many of Shimano's and SRAM's mechanical derailleurs. What I really like is that Microshift offers the Advent 9-speed wide range rear derailleur (it can handle either a 11-42 or 11-46 cassette) and options for brifters, trigger shifter or a bar-end shifter.

I purchased the whole Advent system of 9-speed derailleur with clutch, 11-42 cassette, and bar-end shifter for under $140. Add your favorite 9-speed chain and you have a reliable and solid gear changing solution.

I am currently using this set-up on my Soma Pescadero and have used it on three other bikes. It is so simple to install and maintain. I enjoy how well the shifting works and love the simplicity of the group. It can be used with a 1x or 2x drivetrain too. Simple, reliable, affordable, and future-proof - yep I may be living in the past :)
