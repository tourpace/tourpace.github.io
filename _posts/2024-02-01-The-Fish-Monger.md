My current *"everything"* bike that I now own is built on the Soma Pescadero frameset. I previously was using a Black Mountain Cycles MCD V1 frame that I had acquired from a friend. The MCD was a very good frame but I really wanted to find a frame that didn't have thru-axles and disc brakes.

I know that may sound backwards, but I really love quick releases on my wheels *(of course I use tubes)* and the simplicity of side-pull brakes. So my requirements for a new frame were:

- steel frame and fork
- large clearance for up to 38mm tires
- no thru-axle and no disc brakes
- simple external cable routing (nothing hidden) I like easy access for maintenance
- sidepull or linear pull brakes
- standard threaded bottom bracket shell
- 1-1/8" threadless headset (not integrated)

Soma Fabrications (Merry Sales) offers the [Pescadero frameset](https://www.somafab.com/archives/product/pescadero-frame-set) that ticked all my boxes for my perfect frameset. My build would be components that I either already had and the addition of new parts that are very easy to service while being reliable.

**My build:**

-bottom bracket, Shimano sealed square taper
-crankset, Sugino 5 bolt with 170mm arms
-pedals, Crank Brothers Candy 2
-chaninring, generic narrow-wide 40 tooth alloy
-chain, SRAM 9 speed with Powerlink
-rear derailleur, Microshift Advent 9 speed
-rear cassette, Microshift Advent 11-42
-shifter, Microshift Advent bar-end
-seatpost, Paul Components Tall and Handsome
-saddle, Fabric Radius
-headset, Ritchey Logic sealed
-stem, Paul Components Boxcar
-handlebars - FSA Compact
-brakes, Tektro R559 long reach sidepull
-brake levers, Tektro RL340 Aero
-cables/housing, JagWire
-wheels, H PLUS Son TB14 rims / DT swiss spokes / Shimano 105 hubs / Shimano QR levers
-tires, Panaracer Pasela 700x38

My riding style is more relaxed and I prefer a 1x drivetrain. The Microshift Advent components allow me to have a very wide range with a high gear of 99.3 gear inches and a low gear of 26 gear inches. I also dislike brifters like Shimano STI, SRAM Double-Tap, and the compexity of electronic shifting. Bar end shifting is simple, quick, reliable, and I can always tell what gear I am in by the visual position of the lever.

I hane named this bicycle **FM** for Fish Monger - a possible translation for Pescadero.
