My current single bicycle that I now own and ride is built around the Soma Pescadero frameset. I previously was using a Black Mountain Cycles MCD V1 frame that I had acquired from a friend. The MCD was a very good frame but I really wanted to find a frame that didn't have thru-axles and disc brakes.

I know that may sound backwards, but I really love quick releases on my bicycle wheels *(of course I use tubes)* and the simplicity of side-pull brakes. So my requirements for a new frame were:

- steel frame and fork
- large clearance for up to 38mm tires
- no thru-axle and no disc brakes
- simple external cable routing (nothing hidden) I like easy access for maintenance
- sidepull or linear pull brakes
- standard threaded bottom bracket shell
- 1-1/8" threadless headset (not integrated)

There are still some options in the bicycle industry for a new frame that can meet these specifications other than a custom frame or finding a used frame. Here are a few manufacturers that still offer steel frames that I considered:

- Black Mountain Cycles has the [Monstercoss frame](https://blackmtncycles.com/product-category/monstercross/), I have owned three of these frames in the past.
- Across the pond in the UK is Condor with the [Heritage frameset](https://www.condorcycles.com/products/condor-heritage-frameset?variant=37794547269782)
- [Crust Bikes](https://crustbikes.com/collections/frames) offers the following framesets -  Malocchio, Lightening Bolt Canti, Romanceur, and Nor'easter - all of these frames use 1" threaded forks/headsets.
- C&L Cycles in Montreal has the very nice cross inspired [Bassi Montreal](https://www.clcycle.ca/en/bassi-montreal-v3.html)
- Handsome Cycles has the [Devil](https://handsomecycles.com/products/handsome-devil-chromoly-frameset-shaving-cream), a very nice looking all-rounder.
- [Rivendell](https://www.rivbike.com/collections/current-models) has many nice steel framesets  including the Sam Hillborne and A. Homer Hilsen. You have to act quickly to buy a Rivendell as they often sell-out quickly.
- Surly used to offer the Cross-Check in a rim brake version, [but alas it has been retired](https://velo.outsideonline.com/gravel/gravel-culture/surly-cross-check-discontinued/).
- Soma Fabrications (Merry Sales) offers the [New Albion Privateer](https://www.somafabshop.com/shop/new-albion-frame-privateer-colonial-blue-5316?category=836&search=New+#attr=2976) and the [Pescadero](https://www.somafab.com/archives/product/pescadero-frame-set)

The Soma Pescadero was on-sale and it ticked all my boxes for my perfect frameset. My build would be components that I either already had and the addition of new parts that are very easy to service while being reliable.

**My build:**

- bottom bracket, Shimano sealed square taper
- crankset, Sugino 5 bolt with 170mm arms
- pedals, Crank Brothers Candy 2
- chaninring, generic narrow-wide 40 tooth alloy
- chain, SRAM 9 speed with Powerlink
- rear derailleur, Microshift Advent 9 speed
- rear cassette, Microshift Advent 11-42
- shifter, Microshift Advent bar-end
- seatpost, Paul Components Tall and Handsome
- saddle, Fabric Radius
- headset, Ritchey Logic sealed
- stem, Paul Components Boxcar
- handlebars - FSA Compact
- brakes, Tektro R559 long reach sidepull
- brake levers, Tektro RL340 Aero
- cables/housing, JagWire
- wheels, H PLUS Son TB14 rims / DT swiss spokes / Shimano 105 hubs / Shimano QR levers
- tires, Panaracer Pasela 700x38

My riding style is more relaxed and I prefer a 1x drivetrain. The Microshift Advent components allow me to have a very wide range with a high gear of 99.3 gear inches and a low gear of 26 gear inches. I also dislike brifters like Shimano STI, SRAM Double-Tap, and the compexity of electronic shifting. Bar end shifting is simple, quick, reliable, and I can always tell what gear I am in by the visual position of the lever.

I have named this bicycle **FM** for Fish Monger - a possible translation for Pescadero.
