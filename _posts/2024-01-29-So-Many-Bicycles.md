Over the past 45 years I have owned and ridden many types of bicycles. It is not that I collect bicycles, but I have always enjoyed trying something new and different. I am not a professional blogger who gets bikes, frames, and parts sent to me for reviews. Everything listed below was purchased with my own money and yes it is my vice, so to say.

From my first Univega Viva Sport to a recumbent and even a carbon Pinarello race bike...
Many of these bicycles were purchased as complete bikes from the local bike shop, many were frame only purchases that I built-up, and some were used purchases from other bicyclists. That is 37 bicycles in the past 45 years - so not even one bicycle per year ;)
