I'll make no excuses for liking the simplicity of square taper cranksets. My favorite frames have threaded bottom bracket shells and as such will accept square taper sealed bottom brackets. So when I built up a Soma Pescadero frameset I chose a Shimano sealed square taper bottom bracket. I like that I can choose the length of the bottom bracket spindle to further adjust the chainline of a chosen crankset.

I just like the clean simple look of Sugino cranksets from Japan. This bike build was to be a 1X setup and for this I decided on the Sugino XD2 crankset in black. The XD2 uses 110mm BCD chainrings and it is easy to find 110mm BCD chainrings for a 1X narrow-wide profile. I could have selected a pricier Wolf Tooth 1x chainring but I decided to try a cheaper 1x chainring from Deckas.

I ended up placing the Deckas 40 tooth chainring on the inner position of the Sugino crankset to get the chainline perfectly centered on the cassette. The whole setup is clean looking, ultra smmoth, and quiet. It may not be the lightest option but it will be very durable and reliable.

Just a note - Sugino has been operating since 1910 and continues to survive today, mostly due to the popularity of their track crankset, the Sugino 75.
